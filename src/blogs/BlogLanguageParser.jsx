            This blog walks through how I planned, designed, and developed my personal portfolio website. Iâ€™ll cover my
            process from wireframing to choosing technologies and building responsive sections like About, Projects,
            Blogs, and Contact.
          </p>
          <p>
            The site is built with <strong>React + Vite</strong>, styled with custom CSS, and organized into clean
            sections with responsive design. Animations are added for polish and interactivity.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of my favorite parts is the <em>flip card animation</em> used in Experience and Education, and the
            clickable HomePlate logo in the navbar.
